# For this activity you will need to use casting as appropriate.
# Using the data stored in the above variables:
# 1. Use concatenation to output the sentence - "Bruce is 1.86m tall."
print(name + " is " + str(1.86) + "m tall.")
# 2. Use concatenation to output the sentence - "Bruce is 42 years old."
print(name + " is " + age + " years old.")
# 3. Use concatenation to output the sentence - "Bruce has a high score of 128."
print(name + " has a highscore of " + str(128) + ".")
# 4. Create a new variable called half _age and store in it the result of 42/2 as an integer
half_age = int(42/2)
print("half_age: " + str(half_age))
# 5. Use concatenation to output the sentence - "Half Bruce's age is 21."
print("Half " + name + "'s age is " + str(half_age))
